opinions and ideas. However, the player whose turn it is decides
what to do.
Your hand can have City and Event cards in it. City cards are used
in some actions and Event cards can be played at any time.

You win as soon as you meet the necessary number of objectives. The
game ends immediately, even if it is the middle of a player’s turn or a
series of outbreaks.
There are many ways for the game to end and the players to lose:

Outbreaks Track,
